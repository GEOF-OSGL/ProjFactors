<p>When mapped into the plane by map projection, sphere/spheroid is deformed in certain way.
Every map projection has distinct properties which are usually analysed by some factors.
PROJ4 itself can calculate them and print out if -V option is used.</p>

<p>Main purpose of this plugin is to visualize with map projection distortions, scales or angles. This can help one to decide whether special consideration of distortions is necessary for calculations or analysis performed with GIS operations. Raster data containing scales or distortions can be used in calculations or simply to better understand map projection properties.</p>

Linear scale in Lambert conformal conic projection for Croatia with two standard parallels.</p>

<p>Take a look at the presentation on this topic on FOSS4G 2016, Como, Italy: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B46kztqdEkOHQXJGd3RlUlF3NWs/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B46kztqdEkOHQXJGd3RlUlF3NWs/view</a></p>

<ol>
<li>Meridian scale (h or m) is linear scale along meridians. If it equals to 1, length of meridians 
is preserved and such projections are one kind of equidistant projections, e.g. normal 
aspect conic equidistant projection.</li>
<li>Parallel scale (k or n) is linear scale along parallels. If it equals to 1, length of parallels 
is preserved and such projections are one kind of equidistant projections, e.g. normal aspect 
ortographic projection.</li>
<li>Areal scale (s or p) is ratio of differential area in plane and spheroid. If it equals to 1,
projection is equiareal, e.g. cylindrical equal area projection. p = m<em>n</em>sin(theta) = a * b</li>
<li>Angular distortion (w) is maximal difference of angles in plane and spheroid in a point. 
If equals to 0, map projection is conformal, e.g. Mercator projection. m = n = a = b</li>
<li>Meridian-parallel angle (theta) is angle between mapped meridian and parallel. For example,
normal aspect cylindrical projections have theta = 90 degrees, but not all are conformal.</li>
<li>Convergence (c) is the angle from positive northing axis and tangent to meridian in a point measured positive 
clockwise. In Mercator projection convergence is 0 and bearings from map are true azimuths.</li>
<li>Maximal linear scale (a) of a point defines major axis of Tissot's indicatrix.</li>
<li>Minimal linear scale (b) of a point defines minor axis of Tissot's indicatrix.</li>
</ol>

<a id="recommended-usage" class="anchor" href="#recommended-usage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Recommended usage</h3>

<p>Factors calculated are stored to raster map. Factors are calculated for current Project CRS which should not be geographic or geocentric.</p>

<p>Area for which factors are to be calculated is defined by bounding box in geographic coordinates.</p>

<p>Some projections can't map the whole spheroid. Start with smaller regions and expand as necessary.</p>

<p>Do not use too big raster if it is not necessary (it will take long to generate and resource problems may occur). Size of between 200 and 1000 px should be enough for most purposes. Performance issue is due to fact that in proj_api.h function for projection factors is not published, so standalone proj binary is used as external process (see <a href="https://trac.osgeo.org/proj/ticket/98">https://trac.osgeo.org/proj/ticket/98</a>).</p>

<p>Use inverted pseudocolor spectral palette on min-max values range for nicer colors than default grayscale. With raster contour extraction operation generate isolines and label them for even better understanding of distribution and values of distortions and scales (see above example).</p>
