This can help one to decide whether special consideration of distortions is necessary for calculations or analysis performed with GIS operations. Raster data containing scales or distortions can be used in calculations or simply to better understand map projection properties.\r\n\r\n![Example of using ProjFactors plugin for QGIS](https://github.com/dtutic/ProjFactors/blob/gh-pages/example.png?raw=true)\r\nLinear scale in Lambert conformal conic projection for Croatia with two standard parallels.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the presentation on this topic on FOSS4G 2016, Como, Italy: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B46kztqdEkOHQXJGd3RlUlF3NWs/view\r\n\r\n### Available projection factors\r\n1. Meridian scale (h or m) is linear scale along meridians. If it equals to 1, length of meridians \r\nis preserved and such projections are one kind of equidistant projections, e.g. normal \r\naspect conic equidistant projection.\r\n2. Parallel scale (k or n) is linear scale along parallels. If it equals to 1, length of parallels \r\nis preserved and such projections are one kind of equidistant projections, e.g. normal aspect \r\nortographic projection.\r\n3. Areal scale (s or p) is ratio of differential area in plane and spheroid. If it equals to 1,\r\nprojection is equiareal, e.g. cylindrical equal area projection. p = m n sin(theta) = a b\r\n4. Angular distortion (w) is maximal difference of angles in plane and spheroid in a point. \r\nIf equals to 0, map projection is conformal, e.g. Mercator projection. m = n = a = b\r\n5. Meridian-parallel angle (theta) is angle between mapped meridian and parallel. For example,\r\nnormal aspect cylindrical projections have theta = 90 degrees, but not all are conformal.\r\n6. Convergence (c) is the angle from positive northing axis and tangent to meridian in a point measured positive \r\nclockwise. In Mercator projection convergence is 0 and bearings from map are true azimuths.\r\n7. Maximal linear scale (a) of a point defines major axis of Tissot's indicatrix.\r\n8. Minimal linear scale (b) of a point defines minor axis of Tissot's indicatrix.\r\n\r\n### Recommended usage\r\nFactors calculated are stored as raster map. Factors are calculated for current Project CRS which should not be geographic or geocentric.\r\n\r\nArea for which factors are to be calculated is defined by bounding box in geographic coordinates.\r\n\r\nSome projections can't map the whole spheroid. Start with smaller regions and expand as necessary.\r\n\r\nDo not use too big raster if it is not necessary (it will take long to generate and resource problems may occur). Size of between 200 and 1000 px should be enough for most purposes. Performance issue is due to fact that in proj_api.h function for projection factors is not published, so standalone proj binary is used as external process (see https://trac.osgeo.org/proj/ticket/98).\r\n\r\nUse inverted pseudocolor spectral palette on min-max values range for nicer colors than default grayscale. With raster contour extraction operation generate isolines and label them for even better understanding of distribution and values of distortions and scales (see above example).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAuthor Dražen Tutić (@dtutic), University of Zagreb, Faculty of Geodesy, e-mail: dtutic@geof.hr\r\nLast modified: 06/05/2016\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
